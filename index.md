## Hi, I'm Aleksandra 👋

Welcome to my site! Here’s where I’ll showcase current and past work.
You can find my previous publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e10nsZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).

## About
I'm currently a third year PhD student in Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health working in the [Baker lab](https://www.rachelelizabethbaker.com) and supervised by [Dr. Rachel Baker](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rebaker). My work lies at the interesction of climate and health, and I'm currently using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to assess the impacts of climate on influenza outbreaks. In the past, my work has been funded by the [NASA Rhode Island Space Consortium](https://sites.brown.edu/rispacegrant/).

## Projects

### Climate-disease dynamics
**Modeling the impact of climate extremes on seasonal influenza outbreaks across tropical and temperate locations**
We used a SIR model that incorporated climate as a driver of transmission to assess the impacts of climate variability on projected influenza outbreaks in the United States, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. Work published in [March 2025](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GH001138). 

**Projecting the impact of climate change on influenza outbreaks across temperate and tropical regions**
Currently I'm working with a SIR model to characterize influenza dynamics across a wide range of climate regions.

### Respiratory analyses
I've also aided in responses to emerging influenza outbreaks on a [college campus](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.13151) (including work featured in the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7049e1.htm)) and worked on analyses about [human adenovirus](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/5/ofae192/7641318).
