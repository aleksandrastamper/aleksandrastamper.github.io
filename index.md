- Utilizing publicly available data (e.g., disease surveillance, climate) to advance disease modeling methodology
- Translating academic research into public health policy

## Education
**Master of Applied Science in Spatial Analysis for Public Health**
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2022

**Bachelor of Arts: Biochemistry and Anthropology**
Smith College, 2018
