## About
Hi, I'm Aleksandra. I'm currently a second year PhD student in Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health working in the [Baker lab](https://www.rachelelizabethbaker.com). My work lies at the interesction of climate and health, and I'm currently using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to assess the impacts of climate on influenza outbreaks. In the past, my work has been funded by the [NASA Rhode Island Space Consortium](https://sites.brown.edu/rispacegrant/).

## Interests
- Climate and infectious disease modeling
- Utilizing publicly available data (e.g., disease surveillance, climate) to advance disease modeling methodology
- Translating academic research into public health policy

## Projects

### Climate-disease dynamics
**Modeling the impact of climate extremes on seasonal influenza outbreaks across tropical and temperate locations**

**Projecting the impact of climate change on influenza outbreaks across temperate and tropical regions**


### Respiratory analyses
I've also aided in responses to emerging influenza outbreaks on a [college campus](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.13151) (including work featured in the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7049e1.htm)) and worked on analyses about [human adenovirus](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/5/ofae192/7641318).
